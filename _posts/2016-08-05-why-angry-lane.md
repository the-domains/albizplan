**Why Angry Lane?**

Following their roots of custom made motorcycles, Benoit and Guillaume design, source and build dream machines for each of their individual client looking for something very unique.

The idea of making exceptional bikes was the only serious base to legitimate a future line of gents and ladies apparel / accessories in relation with the world of motorcycles.

With the same mindset, Angry Lane brings to the market products with a new twist: motorcycle inspired fashion luxury apparel with timeless designs that is made to please a much larger urban audience.
