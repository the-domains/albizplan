**The Team**

The daily (actual) operation is and always been (still) managed by Guillaume as a Managing Director and Benoit as a Creative Director. Every aspect from brand identity, to product concepts, designs, sourcing, sampling and final apparel production is still implemented 100% by two person only, Guillaume and Benoit, guaranteeing the lowest cost of operations. This is not taking into account that all the others areas of operations such as managing the Angry Lane showroom in Hong Kong, international online sales, following shops retailing the brand, marketing and PR are also undertaken by them.
