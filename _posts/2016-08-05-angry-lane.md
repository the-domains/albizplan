**Angry Lane**

Angry Lane as a lifestyle brand was born in Hong Kong in 2012, established from the very beginning by two French brothers, Benoit and Guillaume Barras.

The brand DNA comes from a mutual passion: "custom motorcycles" and all related fashion.

Prior to the brand release and for 10 years before that, Benoit and Guillaume spend their own free time and personal money to build passionately a portfolio of suppliers and contacts from Asia, US and Europe guaranteeing the maturity and the success of the brand when ready to be launched internationally.

Angry Lane is now well recognized by international press and social media, compiling a number of spontaneous coverage.

Angry Lane has a story to tell.
